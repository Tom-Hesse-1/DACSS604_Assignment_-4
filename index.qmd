## Introduction

My name is Tom Hesse. I am a student in the University of Masters of Science in Data Analytics & Computational Social Science program at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In undergraduate, I studied Criminal Justice and Psychology at Westfield State University. I am broadly interested in the social sciences, but my specific research interests include demographics, state and national politics, human geography, crime & human behavior, and more. My most recent projects have focused on the rural-urban divide in America, and how immigration is connected to economic growth.
